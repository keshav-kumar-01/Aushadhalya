# TODO List for Adding Footer

- [ ] Add footer element to index.html before </body> with text: "made by Keshav, Akash, Jatin"
- [ ] Add CSS styles for footer in style.css:
  - background color: var(--primary-color)
  - text color: white
  - text alignment: center
  - padding: 1rem 0
  - position: fixed at bottom with full width
  - ensure footer does not overlap content scrolling

- [ ] Test on different pages/views to verify footer presence and style
